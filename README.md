## Technical Requirements
---------------
Problem: Parents have unexpected situations, or even prescheduled arrangements that can lead to confusion during the dismissal process.

Who Would Use It: Both teachers and parents during in person instruction. 
### What's Next/ Stretch Goals?
- Adding an alert/ notifcation system within the app to appear when parents make a change. 
- Improve CSS/ overall flow of the app. Possibly using a different technology to display front end features. 


### Known Bugs?
- Parents can make a log in, but cannot  yet have their own page to display their information. 
- Authenticfication does not extend to the 'New Scholar' and 'New Room' tabs, but user still cannot access room and scholar infromation without logging in.
